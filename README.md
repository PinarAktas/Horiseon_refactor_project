# ChallengeHoriseon

This project is prepared for Upenn Bootcamp. 
Starter code is given to us and we will modify to complete the Challenge.

User Story Part



## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
## Changes

I make some changes in the index.html and style.css . 
All changes are written in the code. I try to write buttom side 
changes, but you can see clearly in the index.htm and style.css .

1 Some codes don't need "/" for closing. For example <meta>, <img>
2 <title> and <link> location is not true. I corrected.
3 type is forgotten in <link>, I add.
4 I make general correction about code order.
5 I made some class names, there are forgatten some places.
6 Some places I prefer to use <header> semantic element In stead of <div>.
7 Firstly class="hero"is in the <div>. But I changed the class="hero" position and add a img, and than put in to img. In     this way I can add alt attribute. I also changed CSS hero part.
8 Some places I prefer to use <main> semantic element In stead of <div>.
9 Some places I prefer to use <article> semantic element In stead of <div>.
10 I add alt attribute to hold a txt description of the image.
11 Some place I prefer to use <footer> semantic element In stead of <div>
